# 🌱 Environment Restoration

![Showcase](assets/showcase.gif)

A creative sandbox game where you restore a broken world using Tetris-like blocks on a Minecraft-inspired terrain.

🧩 Note: This project is currently unfinished, as it’s a mega project for me — I've even built a custom game engine for it!

- Java 17 or later

### 🚀 Running the Game

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TodayNightt/environment_restoration.git
